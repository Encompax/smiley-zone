<h2>2048 Game</h2>
<p>🧩 How It Works
    You start with a 4x4 grid and two tiles, usually 2 or 4.
    Every time you press an arrow key, all tiles slide in that direction.
    If two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one and double in value.
    Example: 2 + 2 → 4, then 4 + 4 → 8, and so on.
    After every move, a new tile appears (usually a 2 or a 4).
    
    💥 Winning
    The game is "won" when you create a tile with the number 2048.
    
    ☠️ Losing
    You lose when the grid is full and no more merges are possible in any direction.</p>
